Congratulations to sophomore Linguistics major Samantha (Sam) Rigor, who was awarded an <a href="https://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant to work on linguistics research in Fall 2021! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Sam Rigor: “Environments affecting the presence of coda /t/ and /d/ in Asian American speech”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Fall 2021, Sam will conduct an acoustic and auditory study of Asian Americans' interview speech in English to examine (1) the degree to which they produce coda /t/ and/or /d/ deletion, (2) the environments in which such deletion occurs, and (3) the social factors that relate to the occurrence of this deletion.</p>
