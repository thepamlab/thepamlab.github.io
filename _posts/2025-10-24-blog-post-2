Prof. Chang, along with Profs. Sunyoung Ahn and Youngjoo Kim, just published a new open-access article entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02806-z" target="_blank">"LexKO: A quick, reliable lexical test of Korean language proficiency"</a> in <i>Behavior Research Methods</i>!
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span>: To facilitate objective measures of proficiency for language users of diverse backgrounds, recent research in second language acquisition and multilingualism has developed short, yet reliable, tests of lexical knowledge in a wide range of languages. In this paper, we describe the development of LexKO, a brief lexically based test of Korean language proficiency, including its underlying logic, composition, intended use, and limitations. Three rounds of pilot and validation testing with first- and second-language Korean users resulted in a highly reliable Korean test comprising 60 items that can be completed in a few minutes. Freely available for other researchers to use, LexKO produces scores that correlate significantly with both first- and second-language Korean users’ scores on a standardized proficiency test (an abridged version of the Test of Proficiency in Korean) and may thus be helpful in multi-part studies for obtaining a quick, valid measure of proficiency in Korean, one of the world’s fastest-growing foreign languages.</p>
