Our own Jupitara Ray is presenting a poster (co-authored with Prof. Chang) at this week's 50th <a href="https://www.bu.edu/bucld" target="_blank">Boston University Conference on Language Development</a> (BUCLD 50)! The title of their presentation, scheduled for the Friday afternoon poster session, is "L2 influence, L1 resilience: Change and stability in early bilingual speakers of Indian English".
