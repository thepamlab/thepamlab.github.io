Congratulations to Aspen Bombardo, who was awarded an <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant to continue working on research in the lab in Fall 2018! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Aspen Bombardo: “Variation in the production of English consonant clusters by Asian American bilinguals”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Aspen will be working on a sociophonetic research project examining features of English and heritage languages spoken by Asian Americans, across a range of ethnicities and life histories in the U.S. In Fall 2018, Aspen will be involved in analyzing speech recordings from a pilot corpus of interviews, with a focus on variation in the production of consonant clusters by Asian Americans who learned English as a second language.</p>
