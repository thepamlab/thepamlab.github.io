Congratulations to sophomore Linguistics minor Madelyn (Maddie) Jin, who was awarded an <a href="https://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant to work on linguistics research in Spring 2024! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Maddie Jin: “The impact of speech rhythm in the production and perception of Asian-ness in American English”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Spring 2024, Maddie will conduct an acoustic study of Asian Americans' interview speech in English to examine aspects of their speech rhythm and the degree to which there are differences with respect to English speakers of other ethnoracial backgrounds.</p>
