A chapter entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009105767.033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Phonetic and phonological L1 attrition and drift in bilingual speech"</a> (de Leeuw &amp; Chang, 2024) has been published by Cambridge University Press in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-cambridge-handbook-of-bilingual-phonetics-and-phonology/66A8D970A8E88C3F41D905A144F7AB61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Cambridge Handbook of Bilingual Phonetics and Phonology</i></a>, edited by Mark Amengual.  
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span>: This chapter presents an overview of what is currently known about phonetic and phonological first language (L1) attrition and drift in bilingual speech and introduces a new theory of bilingual speech, Attrition & Drift in Access, Production, and Perception Theory (ADAPPT). Attrition and drift are defined and differentiated along several dimensions, including duration of change, source in second language (L2) experience, consciousness, agency, and scope. We address why findings of attrition and drift are important for our overall understanding of bilingual speech and draw links between ADAPPT and well-known theories of L2 speech, such as the revised Speech Learning Model (SLM-r), the Perceptual Assimilation Model-L2 (PAM-L2), and the Second Language Linguistic Perception model (L2LP). The significance of findings revealing attrition and drift is discussed in relation to different linguistic subfields. The chapter raises the question of how attrition and drift potentially interact to influence speech production and perception in the bilingual’s L1 over the life span; additional directions for future research are pointed out as well.</p>
