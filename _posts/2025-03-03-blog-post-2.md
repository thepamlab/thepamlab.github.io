Kudos to our own Jupitara Ray, whose abstract with Prof. Chang was accepted to the 15th International Symposium on Bilingualism!

The title of their presentation is "Phonetic accommodation in Hindi–English and Telugu–English early sequential bilinguals: The roles of category establishment and phonetic dissimilarity".
