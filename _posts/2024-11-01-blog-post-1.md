This semester, Prof. Chang has been busy talking about recent work in the lab! 

In October, he gave at a talk at LMU Munich's <a href="https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing</a> entitled "Investigating predictors of regressive cross-linguistic influence in multilingual speech". 

In November, he will be giving two talks at <a href="https://cc.au.dk/en/about-the-school/departments/english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aarhus University</a>, one talk entitled "Aspects of cross-language interactions in multilingual speech perception and production" and a workshop entitled "Measuring proficiency in L2 and bilingualism research". 

Finally, in December, he will be delivering the LinguisticsNOW Colloquium at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/linguistics.html" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a> (jointly organized with the University of British Columbia). The title of his colloquium is "The multilingual mind as a window onto linguistic knowledge".
