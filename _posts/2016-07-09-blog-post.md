A research article entitled "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728914000261" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Bilingual perceptual benefits of experience with a heritage language</span></a>" (Chang, 2016) has been published in the August issue of <i>Bilingualism: Language and Cognition</i>.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span>: Research on the linguistic knowledge of heritage speakers has been concerned primarily with the advantages conferred by heritage language experience in production, perception, and (re)learning of the heritage language. Meanwhile, second-language speech research has begun to investigate potential benefits of first-language transfer in second-language performance. Bridging these two bodies of work, the current study examined the perceptual benefits of heritage language experience for heritage speakers of Korean in both the heritage language (Korean) and the dominant language (American English). It was hypothesized that, due to their early bilingual experience and the different nature of unreleased stops in Korean and American English, heritage speakers of Korean would show not only native-like perception of Korean unreleased stops, but also better-than-native perception of American English unreleased stops. Results of three perception experiments were consistent with this hypothesis, suggesting that benefits of early heritage language experience can extend well beyond the heritage language.</p>
