Welcome to the new students who will be joining the lab this fall:
<ul>
 	<li><span><strong>Sara Hockett</strong> (BU GRS '28) is a first-year PhD student in Linguistics. Her research interests include second language acquisition, phonological theory, and multilingualism interactions. She’s specifically looking to examine how the transfer or inhibition from one’s first language to the learning of a second can inform broader phonological theories related to sonority.</span></li>
 	<li><b>Jason Wang</b> is a rising senior at Concord Carlisle High School. He is interested in phonetics, acquisition, multilingualism, and the neuroscience of language and speech production.</li>
</ul>
<span>And a warm welcome back to Felix and Jackson!</span>
