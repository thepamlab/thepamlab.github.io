Congratulations to Jupitara Ray, whose abstract with Prof. Chang was accepted to the 188th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, to be held jointly with the 25th International Congress on Acoustics in May in New Orleans!

The title of their poster, to be presented by Jupitara, is "Testing the role of L1 influence in phonetic accommodation by Indian English bilinguals".
