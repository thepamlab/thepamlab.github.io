Lab affiliates past and present will be presenting at this week's International Austronesian and Papuan Languages and Linguistics Conference (APLL12), hosted virtually by the University of Oslo!

Lab alumna Megan Brown is giving a talk on "Variation in Ende word order".

Prof. <a href="https://katelynnlindsey.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey</a> is delivering (with Katherine Anne Strong) an early career plenary on "Sociophonetic variation in the South Fly: Evidence from Ende", and is also giving a talk on "Capturing breadth and depth in the documentation of Ende".
