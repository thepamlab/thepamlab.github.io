Felix Kpogo was busy this month giving presentations at the <a href="https://acal55.mull-lab.org/program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55th Annual Conference on African Linguistics</a> (ACAL 55) in Montreal and at the 186th Meeting of the <a href="https://acousticalsociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acoustical Society of America</a> in Ottawa (joint with Acoustics Week in Canada). His ACAL talk was entitled "Locality effects in [Ã¦] vowel production in Twi", and his ASA poster was entitled "Harmony in transition: Exploring the perception-production relationship in sound change".
