Kudos to junior Linguistics major Sam Rigor (BU CAS '24) and recent alum Kate Fraser (BU CAS '22) on their acceptances to the upcoming Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA 2023), to take place in January!

Sam will present the poster "Coronal stop deletion in Asian American speech: Effects of phonology, ethnicity, and language use" (co-authored with Prof. Chang).

Kate will present the talk "Perception of Asian American identity in speech: The role of listener background and ideology" (co-authored with Prof. Chang).

Congratulations to all!
