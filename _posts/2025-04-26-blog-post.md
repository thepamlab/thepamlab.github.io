This spring, Prof. Chang has been busy talking about work in the lab!

In March, he gave at a talk at the University of California, Irvine's <a href="https://www.langsci.uci.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Language Science</a>, and in April, he gave at a talk at the University of Konstanz's <a href="https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Linguistics</a>.

In May, he will be giving two talks, one at the <a href="https://www.linguistik.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zurich Center for Linguistics</a> as part of the Phonetics and Speech Science Colloquium and the other as a keynote speaker at the 4th <a href="https://asefola.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advances in Second/Foreign Language Acquisition Conference</a> (ASeFoLA 2025) on the theme of "Heritage Language Acquisition and Learning" (organized by the University of Nicosia, Cyprus). His ASeFoLA keynote is entitled "Navigating complexity, competition, and unpredictability as a heritage speaker".

Finally, in June, he will be participating as part of a panel on the study of sounds in heritage languages at the <a href="https://nhlrc.ucla.edu/nhlrc/event/16980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16th Heritage Language Research Institute</a> at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
