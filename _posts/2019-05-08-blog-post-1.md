Congratulations to Jiangnan (Michael) Fang, who was awarded an <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) Humanities Scholars Award to work on research in Summer 2019! Below is a brief description of the project he will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Jiangnan (Michael) Fang: “De-linking between words in conversational English by native speakers of Mandarin”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Michael will be working on a sociophonetic research project examining features of English spoken by Asian Americans, across a range of ethnicities and life histories in the U.S. In Summer 2019, Michael will analyze speech recordings from interviews with Chinese Americans who learned English as a second language, with a focus on their production of connected speech phenomena such as resyllabification.</p>
