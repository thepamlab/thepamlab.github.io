Congratulations to Michael Fang, who was awarded an <a href="https://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant -- specifically, a Humanities Scholars Award -- to continue working on research in Summer 2020! Below is a brief description of the project he will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Jiangnan (Michael) Fang: “De-linking between words in conversational English by native speakers of Mandarin”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Summer 2020, Michael will acoustically analyze speech recordings from interviews with native Mandarin speakers who learned English as a second language, with a focus on their production of connected speech phenomena such as resyllabification and glottalization.</p>
