Congratulations to Aspen Bombardo, who was awarded a second <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant to continue working on research in Spring 2019! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Aspen Bombardo: “Variation in the production of English consonant clusters by Asian American bilinguals”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Aspen will be working on a sociophonetic research project examining features of English and heritage languages spoken by Asian Americans, across a range of ethnicities and life histories in the U.S. In Spring 2019, Aspen will analyze speech recordings from interviews with Vietnamese Americans and Chinese Americans who learned English as a second language, with a focus on variation in the production of /sC/ consonant clusters.</p>
