Congratulations to Sharmaine Sun and Kathryn Turner, who were awarded <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grants to work on research in the lab in Summer 2017! Below are brief descriptions of the projects they will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Sharmaine Sun: "Language use and perceptions of Asian Bostonians"</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sharmaine will be working on a sociophonetic research project with two components: (1) examining features of English and heritage languages spoken by Asian Americans, across a range of ethnicities and life histories in the U.S., and (2) testing the perception, by both Asian and non-Asian American listeners, of Asian racial/ethnic identity in the speech of Asian American English users. Sharmaine will be involved in both the collection and the analysis of pilot data on this project.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Kathryn Turner: "Development of speech production in Korean-English bilingual children"</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Kathryn will be continuing her work on a project comparing the speech production of young children acquiring both Korean and English with that of age-matched children acquiring only one of these languages. The goal of this project is to better understand how bilingual children differ from monolingual children with respect to the arc of their language development. Kathryn will contribute to the acoustic analysis of audio recordings from an elicited production task with 3- and 5-year-old children, focusing on fricative production.</p>
