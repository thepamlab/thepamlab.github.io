Congratulations to junior Linguistics major Kate Fraser, who was awarded an <a href="https://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant -- specifically, a Humanities Scholars Award -- to work on linguistics research in Summer 2021! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Kate Fraser: “Listener perception and identification of Asian American speech”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Summer 2021, Kate will conduct a perception study to examine how consistently listeners can identify Asian Americans on the basis of their English speech, how detailed such perceptual judgments are, and how listeners' own race/ethnicity and exposure to Asian Americans in their community influence their judgments.</p>
