Congratulations to Kathryn Turner, whoÂ was awarded an <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant to work on research in the lab in Spring 2017! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Kathryn Turner: "Development of speech production in Korean-English bilingual children"</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Kathryn will be comparing the speech production of young children acquiring both Korean and English with that of age-matched children acquiring only one of these languages. The goal of this project is to better understand how bilingual children differ from monolingual children with respect to the arc of their language development. Kathryn will contribute to the acoustic analysis of audio recordings from an elicited production task with 10-year-old children, focusing on fricative production.</p>
