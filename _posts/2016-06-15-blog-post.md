A research article entitled "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2016.0031" target="_blank"><span class="s1">On the cognitive basis of contact-induced sound change: Vowel merger reversal in Shanghainese</span></a>" (Yao &amp; Chang, 2016) has been published in the June issue of <i>Language</i>, the journal of the Linguistic Society of America.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span>: This study investigates the source and status of a recent sound change in Shanghainese (Wu, Sinitic) that has been attributed to language contact with Mandarin. The change involves two vowels, /e/ and /ɛ/, reported to be merged three decades ago but produced distinctly in contemporary Shanghainese. Results of two production experiments show that speaker age, language mode (monolingual Shanghainese vs. bilingual Shanghainese-Mandarin), and crosslinguistic phonological similarity all influence the production of these vowels. These findings provide evidence for language contact as a linguistic means of merger reversal and are consistent with the view that contact phenomena originate from cross-language interaction within the bilingual mind.</p>
