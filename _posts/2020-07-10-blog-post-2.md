Congratulations to Aspen Bombardo, whose proposal with Prof. Chang was accepted for presentation at the 2020 <a href="https://convention.asha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Convention</a>! Unfortunately, the convention has been canceled due to COVID-19. The proposal would have reported the results of Aspen's <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UROP</a> research:
<ul>
 	<li>Aspen Bombardo &amp; Charles B. Chang: “<span>Variation in production of English consonant clusters by Asian American bilinguals</span>”</li>
</ul>
