Congratulations to Sharmaine Sun, who was awarded an <a href="http://www.bu.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> (UROP) grant to continue working on research in the lab in Summer 2018! Below is a brief description of the project she will be working on:
<ul>
 	<li>Sharmaine Sun: “Language use and perceptions of Asian Bostonians”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sharmaine will be working on a sociophonetic research project with two components: (1) examining features of English and heritage languages spoken by Asian Americans, across a range of ethnicities and life histories in the U.S., and (2) testing the perception, by both Asian and non-Asian American listeners, of Asian racial/ethnic identity in the speech of Asian American English users. In Summer 2018, Sharmaine will be involved in analyzing speech recordings from a pilot corpus of interviews as well as conducting a perception experiment to examine the social evaluation of Asian American males by straight female and gay male listeners.</p>
