This spring, Prof. Chang has been busy talking about work in the lab!

In March, he gave at a talk at the University of California, Irvine's Department of Language Science, and in April, he gave at a talk at the University of Konstanz's Department of Linguistics.

In May, he will be giving two talks, one at the Zurich Center for Linguistics as part of the Phonetics and Speech Science Colloquium and the other as a keynote speaker at the 4th Advances in Second/Foreign Language Acquisition Conference (ASeFoLA 2025) on the theme of "Heritage Language Acquisition and Learning" (organized by the University of Nicosia, Cyprus). His ASeFoLA keynote is entitled "Navigating complexity, competition, and unpredictability as a heritage speaker".

Finally, in June, he will be participating as part of a panel on the study of sounds in heritage languages at the 16th Heritage Language Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
