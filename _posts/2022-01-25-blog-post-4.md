Congratulations to Kate Fraser, whose work on the Asian Americans in Boston project was accepted for presentation at the UC Berkeley Society of Linguistics Undergraduate Students (SLUgS) 6th Annual Undergraduate Linguistics Symposium! The title of the presentation is "Listener perception and identification of Asian American Speech". Brava, Kate!
