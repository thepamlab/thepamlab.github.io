<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sharmaine will be working on a sociophonetic research project investigating features of English and heritage languages spoken by Asian Americans, across a range of ethnicities and life histories in the U.S. In Spring 2018, Sharmaine will continue contributing to the analysis of pilot data, including interviews and socio-demographic questionnaires.
