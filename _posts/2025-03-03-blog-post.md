Kudos to our own <a href="https://jupitararay.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupitara Ray</a>, whose abstract with Prof. Chang was accepted to the <a href="https://www.bcbl.eu/events/isb15/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15th International Symposium on Bilingualism</a>!

The title of their presentation is <span>"Phonetic accommodation in Hindi–English and Telugu–English early sequential bilinguals: The roles of category establishment and phonetic dissimilarity".</span>
