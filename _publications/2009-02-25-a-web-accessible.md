In recent years, building web-accessible dictionaries has become a new way of organizing and publishing data from linguistic fieldwork on indigenous languages. This paper provides an overview of one such online dictionary. The language we worked on was Southeastern Pomo, an endangered native American language which was historically spoken in the area of Clear Lake, California. The structure of the dictionary and the files that are needed to construct it are introduced in detail. We also demonstrate three types of searches that are made available on the dictionary website.
