If you are considering Prof. Chang as a supervisor for a <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/programmes-courses/master-philosophy-mphil-and-doctor-philosophy-phd-research-degrees" target="_blank">PhD at CityU</a>, please read this page.

First, familiarize yourself with the structure of CityU's <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sgs/student/rpg/courses/courselist/lt" target="_blank">PhD program</a> and <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/entrance-requirements" target="_blank">admission requirements</a>.

Second, contact Prof. Chang (by email) well in advance of the application deadline (= 1 December) with a CV and a draft of your research proposal. He will get back to you with feedback as to whether you might be a good fit for the lab's work. (If you are not able to start discussing supervision with Prof. Chang before 1 November, it is probably too late to apply in the current application cycle and you should aim instead to apply in the following year's cycle.)

If you mean to inquire about Prof. Chang co-supervising your PhD with a professor at your home institution or joining your dissertation committee as an external member, please discuss this first with your supervisor (committee chair) at your home institution before contacting Prof. Chang.
