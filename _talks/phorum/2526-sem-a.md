The CityU Phonetics and Phonology Forum ("Phorum") has been officially established! We are a research and discussion group centered around all phonetic and phonological aspects of speech: articulation, acoustics, aerodynamics, processing, perception, sociophonetics, speech learning, multilingual speech, speech disorders, etc. Comprising CityU LT's <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/en/people/academic-staff" target="_blank">academic staff</a> and <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/en/people/research-students" target="_blank">students</a> in phonetics and phonology, we meet on a roughly biweekly basis to present our ongoing work, hear from outside speakers, and discuss recent papers of interest.

In Semester A of 2025-26, we did not hold a regular meeting schedule. Stay tuned for our schedule of meetings in Semester B.
