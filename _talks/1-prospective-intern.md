If you would like to join the lab as a volunteer intern, please read this page.

Current CityU as well as non-CityU students (undergraduate or postgraduate) can join the lab as a research intern on a volunteer basis; CityU undergraduates can also intern for academic credit. If you are interested in joining the lab as an intern, please apply by <a href="mailto:pam.lab@cityu.edu.hk">email</a> with:
<ol>
 	<li>a copy of your CV/résumé</li>
 	<li>a summary of relevant coursework (e.g., an unofficial transcript)</li>
 	<li>a short statement about your interests in linguistics (especially as regards the research foci of the lab: phonetics, language acquisition, and multilingualism)</li>
  <li>your intended time commitment (i.e., number of hours per week)</li>
</ol>

Note that we ask for a minimum commitment of 75 hours total (i.e., approximately 5 hours/week during the fall or spring semester and 6 hours/week during the summer).

If you are a CityU student who would like to carry out a project for academic credit, please include in your application which course pathways you are interested in (e.g., LT4391), as well as any specific project ideas you may have. 

If you are a non-CityU student who is applying for, or has already obtained, independent funding that carries specific reporting requirements (e.g., a summer internship/research grant from your home institution), please include this information in your application.
