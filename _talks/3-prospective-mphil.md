If you are considering Prof. Chang as a supervisor for an <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/programmes-courses/master-philosophy-mphil-and-doctor-philosophy-phd-research-degrees" target="_blank">MPhil at CityU</a>, please read this page.

First, familiarize yourself with the structure of CityU's <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sgs/student/rpg/courses/courselist/lt" target="_blank">MPhil program</a> and <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/entrance-requirements" target="_blank">admission requirements</a>.

Second, contact Prof. Chang (by email) well in advance of the application deadline (= 1 December), preferably with a CV and a draft of your research proposal. He will get back to you with feedback as to whether you might be a good fit for the lab's work. (If you are not able to start discussing supervision with Prof. Chang before 1 November, it is probably too late to apply in the current application cycle and you should aim instead to apply in the following yearâ€™s cycle.)
