Recruiting Chinese Americans (Mandarin heritage speakers) for a listening study!

Requirements: age 18+; raised in the US starting before age 6; no history of speech or hearing issues; grew up with Mandarin spoken at home.

This is a computer-based listening study which involves giving judgments on spoken Mandarin sentences, as well as reading a few sentences out loud while being audio-recorded. The study will take place remotely from your own quiet location. If you are eligible to participate, you will arrange to complete one session of 90-120 minutes. If you complete the study, you will be compensated $50 via an electronic gift card to Amazon.

To sign up for the study, please scan the QR code on the flyer below, or email the study coordinator at <a href='mailto:linguisticsexperiment@gmail.com'>linguisticsexperiment@gmail.com</a>.
